To run the code
----------------

1. Open `src/NancyBlog.sln` in Visual Studio.
2. Hit `F5` (or the Start Debugging button).

Database should just be there, we are using attached SQL Server Express DB file in the `App_Data` folder. 

Usually you'll get SQL Server Express installed when you installed Visual Studio, but it didn't then should download and install SQL Server Express.
