Nancy
=====

A Simple Blog App with **Nancy** (hosted on ASP.NET) and **ServiceStack.OrmLite** for persistence.

* [Nancy](http://nancyfx.org) is a lightweight, low-ceremony, framework for building HTTP based services on .NET and Mono.
* [ServiceStack.OrmLite](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite) is a convention-based, configuration-free lightweight ORM that uses standard POCO classes and Data Annotation attributes to infer its table schema. It is a part of the [ServiceStack](http://www.servicestack.net/) project.

This project was created to learn these frameworks.


To Run
------

1. Open `src/NancyBlog.sln` in Visual Studio.
2. Hit `F5` (or the Start Debugging button).
3. Create tables by clicking the link in the home page.

Database should just be there, we are using embedded SQL Express in the `App_Data` folder.
